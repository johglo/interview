# FizzBuzz 

Please open the project [FizzBuzz](FizzBuzz/FizzBuzz.csproj) and talk us through your implementation for the
use case desribed here (also in the project).

## Overview
The standard "FizzBuzz" coding example from Imran Ghory, used for testing basline competence in programming.

There are many possible solutions.  The point is to ensure that the user has at least a minimal level of syntactic
and algorithmic understanding.  And it is a good chance to experience the user's coding style and thought process.

## Instructions
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 on separate, consecutive lines. 
But for multiples of the number three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for 
multiples of the number five print "Buzz".  For numbers which are multiples of both 
three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Those numbers in sequence would look like this:
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    ...
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16
    ...
    98
    Fizz
    Buzz

# Code Review

This exercise is intended to let us observe how you read and respond to code written by other engineers.
The project is a calculator for prime numbers using an algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes; it
currently functions properly but the code is an unmaintainable mess. 

Open the [project](CodeReview) and review the code contained in [Project.cs](CodeReview/Program.cs).
Please verbalize any issues you find and discuss the severity of the issue.
